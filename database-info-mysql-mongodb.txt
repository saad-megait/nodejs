Types of database 

1: MySQL
2: MongoDB
3: Oracle MS SQL Server 
4: MS SQL Server
5: Postgre SQL 


1. MySQL
---------------------------------------------

- Relational Database 
- noSQL ( Structured Query Language )

NoSQL 
	- NoSQL is not a table based batabase, its document based
	- like MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra etc...

---------------------------------------------

What is Constaints : Its a restriction 
	- NOT NULL
	- UNIQUE
	- DEFAULT 
	- CHECK	
	- PRIMARY KEY 	
	- FOREIGN KEY 

---------------------------------------------

Primery key and Foreign Key :

- Primery key :- 
	- Always have unique data 00
	- Cannot have null value
	- A table can contain only one primary key constrain
	
	If table is already created then needs to add primery key.
	- ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMERY KEY (id)

- Foreign key :-
	- is a key used to link two tables together 
	- in one table used to point PRIMERY KEY in another table.

- Query Example :
	CREATE TABLE student (
		id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
		name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
		age INT NOT NULL,
		city VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
		PRIMERY KEY (id)
		FOREIGN KEY (city) REFERNCES city(cid) // this line set foreign key from city table of cid
	);
	
---------------------------------------------

Queries :- 
	- SELECT :- for read the records			--> SELECT * FROM employees;
	- INSERT :- for inserting the record 			--> INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, job_title, salary)
									VALUES ('Alice', 'Johnson', 'Designer', 50000);
	- UPDATE :- for updating the specified record 		--> UPDATE employees
									SET salary = 55000
									WHERE id = 123;
	- DELETE :- for delete the record			--> DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 456;

---------------------------------------------

LIKE Operator with Wildcard Patterns :
WildCard Character : 
1: % Percentage Sign :- Represents zero, one, or multiple characters
2: _ Underscore :- Represents a single character 

Pattern		Descriptions 
LIKE 'a%' 	- Start with 'a'
LIKE '%a' 	- End with 'a'
LIKE '%am%' 	- have 'am' in any position
LIKE 'a%m' 	- Start with 'a' and End with 'm'
LIKE '__a%' 	- 'a' in the second position
LIKE '___a'	- 'a' in the third position
LIKE '_oy' 	- 'o' in the second and 'y' in the third position
i.e SELECT firstname, email, phone, age, gender FROM users WHERE firstname NOT LIKE 's%';

---------------------------------------------

SQL Commands :
- SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE age NOT IN (24,46); ----> its not returning any recond of which has age 24 and 46
- SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE age BETWEEN 50 AND 60; ----> its return the record which has age between 50 to 60
- SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE age NOT BETWEEN 50 AND 60; ----> its return all the record except the age between 50 to 60

---------------------------------------------

Select Data with Regular Expression:
Sign 		Pattern 		Description
^ 		'^ra' 			Beginning of string
$ 		'an$'			End of string
[...] 		'[rms]'			Any character listed between the square brackets
^[...]		'^[rms]' 		Begins with any character listed between the square brackets
[a-z] 		'[a-h]e'		Match with in the range
p1|p2|p3 	'tom|dean|harry 	Matches any of the patterns p1,p2 or p3 

- SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE firstname REGEXP 'ns$';
SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE firstname REGEXP '[t-z]';

---------------------------------------------

Aggregate Function : 
	- Aggregate function in MYSQL are special function that perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value as a result

	Number of Types : 
	1 - COUNT()	--> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;	Counts number of rows 
	2 - SUM()	--> SELECT SUM(age) FROM students; 	Returns sum of all students age	
	3 - AVG()	--> SELECT AVG(age) FROM students;	Returns the average age of students 		
	4 - MAX() 	--> SELECT MAX(price) FROM students;	Returns the MAX age student record
	5 - MIN() 	--> SELECT MIN(score) FROM students;	Returns the MIN age student record

---------------------------------------------

ORDER BY : 
SELECT * FROM `users`ORDER BY firstname DESC;

DISTINCT : Remove duplicate values
SELECT DISTINCT age FROM `users` ORDER BY age;

---------------------------------------------

Types of Join in SQL 

1: Inner Join 
2: Left Join  (or Left Outer Join )
3: Right Join	( or right outer join )
4: Full Outer Join 
5: Self Join
5: Cross Join


1 ---> INNER JOIN
	The INNER JOIN selectd records that have matching values in both tables : get the same value
	- Query Example : SELECT * from students INNER JOIN city on students.city = city.cid; --> it returns only matchable records from both tables

2 ---> LEFT JOIN
	The LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left table ( table1 ) 
		and the matched records from the right table ( table2 )
	- Query Example : SELECT * from students LEFT JOIN city on students.city = city.cid;   --> it returns matchable record from both tables and as well as return all the records of table1

3 ---> RIGHT JOIN
	The RIGHT JOIN returns all records from the right table ( table2 )
		and the matched records from the left table ( table1 )
	- Query Example : SELECT * from students RIGHT JOIN city on students.city = city.cid; --> it returns matchable record from both tables and as well as return all the records of table2

4 ---> CROSS JOIN
	Query Example :-
	- SELECT * from students CROSS JOIN city; 
	- SELECT * from students, city; --> this command worked same as cross join

---------------------------------------------

GROUP BY : 
	The GROUP BY clause is used in conjunction with the SELECT statement
 	and Aggregate functions to group rows together by common column values
	- Query Example : 
		SELECT c.cname,COUNT(s.city) as total from students s INNER JOIN city c ON s.city = c.cid WHERE s.age > 25 GROUP BY city;

HAVING Clause : 
	- Query Example : 
		SELECT s.name, c.cname, s.age, COUNT(s.city) as Total FROM students s JOIN city c on s.city = c.cid GROUP BY s.city having s.age > 25 and COUNT(s.city) >= 1; 

---------------------------------------------

Commit and Rollback

---------------------------------------------

Join Multiple Table : 
	Query Example :
	
		SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name, products.product_name
		FROM orders
		INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
		INNER JOIN order_details ON orders.order_id = order_details.order_id
		INNER JOIN products ON order_details.product_id = products.product_id
		WHERE orders.order_date >= '2023-01-01';

---------------------------------------------

SubQuery / Nested Query

	Nested Query : 	
	- Query Example :-
		- SELECT name FROM `students` WHERE city = (SELECT cid FROM city WHERE cname = 'Mumbai'); --> For only signle columns search
		- SELECT name FROM `students` WHERE city IN (SELECT cid FROM city WHERE cname IN ('Mumbai','Ahmedabad')); --> For fetching multiple columns

EXIST - NOT EXIST : 
	
	EXIST :- If any single recond exist THEN parent command show result		--> SELECT name FROM `students` WHERE EXISTS (SELECT cid FROM city c WHERE cname IN ('Mumbai', 'Ahmedabad'));
	NOT EXIST : If not any single record exist THEN parent command show result 	--> SELECT name FROM `students` WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT cid FROM city c WHERE cname IN ('xyz', 'test'));
	
UNION / UNION ALL 

	Rules for using UNION AND UNION ALL
		- Each statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
		- The columns must have also similar data types
		- The columns in each select statement must also be in the same order

---------------------------------------------

- Arithmetic Function : 

	1. ABS() :- its only return positive Value 
		i.e ABS(-6.2) : 6.2
	
	2. FLOOR() :- Its only returns before poining value
		i.e FLOOR(4.5) : 4
	
	3. CEIL() : Its return after poining value
		i.e CEIL(4.5) : 5

	4. ROUND() : Its returb based on point value, if its less the 0.5 then it returns 0 and if more than 0.6 then it return 1

	5. SQRT() : 
	6. POW() : 
	7. RAND() :  
	8. SIGN() :

- Sting Function :
	
	1. UPPER()/UCASE()
	2. LOWER()/LCASE()
	3. LENGTH()
	4. CHAR_LENGTH()
	5. CONCAT()
	6. CONCAT_WS()
	7. LTRIM()
	8. RTRIM()
	9. POSITION 
	10. LOCATE()
	11. INSTR()
	
- Date Function : 
	
	1. CURDATE
	2. CURRENT_DATE
	3. SYSDATE 
	4. NOW
	5. LAST_DAY
	6. DAY
	7. DAYNAME

---------------------------------------------

MySQL queries :-

1. find the third-highest salary.
	SELECT * FROM employeeinfo ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 2,1

2. find the nth highest salary from the table without using TOP/LIMIT keywords.
	SELECT salary FROM employeeinfo e1 WHERE 2 = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT salary) from employeeinfo e2 WHERE e2.salary > e1.salary);

3. find the duplicate row in a table.
	SELECT *, COUNT(id) FROM employeeinfo GROUP BY id HAVING COUNT(id) > 1

4. calculating the even and odd records from a table.
	MOD : store the division
	SELECT * FROM employeeinfo WHERE MOD(id,2) = 1; : its return even records
	SELECT * FROM employeeinfo WHERE MOB(id,2) = 0; : its return odd records

5. display the first and last record from the table.
	SELECT * from employeeinfo WHERE id = (SELECT MIN(id) FROM employeeinfo); : its returns first record	
	SELECT * FROM employeeinfo WHERE id = (SELECT MAX(id) FROM employeeinfo); : returns last record

6. how do you copy all rows of a table.
	- CREATE TABLE empdetails AS SELECT * FROM employeeinfo :-- for copy the all fields of record using *
	- CREATE TABLE empsalary AS SELECT id,salary FROM employeeinfo :-- for selected fields copy
	- CREATE TABLE emptest as SELECT * FROM employeeinfo WHERE 3=4 :-- for copy the schema 

7. retrieve the list of employee working on same department.
	- SELECT DISTINCT e1.id,e1.fname,e1.department FROM employeeinfo e1, employeeinfo e2 WHERE e1.department = e2.department and e1.id != e2.id;

8. retrieve last 3 records from the table.
	- SELECT* from (SELECT * from employeeinfo ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 3) temp ORDER BY id ASC;
	- SELECT * FROM employeeinfo ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 3. : It return last 3 records from the table but it reverse order :)

9. fetch details of employees whose lname ends with an alphabet 'A' and contains five alphabets 
	- SELECT * FROM employeeinfo WHERE lname LIKE '____a'

10. fetch 50% records of the table
	It works only in where employee id is in proper sequence : no record deleted
	- SELECT * FROM employeeinfo WHERE id <= (SELECT COUNT(id)/2 FROM employeeinfo)

Have to install MongoDB Powershell  // 20/11/24 

then open MongoDB Powershell 

For show all the database : show dbs

Commands :

 	Create New Database : use database_name / use organization_management
	Show all collections : show collections ( we should be inside database or currect database should be connected)
	Create new Collection/Table and insert record : db.users.insertOne({name:'Saad', age:20})
	For list down all the records : db.users.find() -> this will return all the records from 'user' collection/table

	CRUD operation overview from MongoDB

	Create : 
		db.users.insertOne(data, options)
		db.users.insertMany(data, options)

		db.users.insert({name:'saad', age:12}) : db.users.insert become old version, suggest to use insertOne but its insert the record in users collection/table
		db.users.insertOne({name:'saad', age:12}) : wil insert the new record
		db.users.insertMany([{name:'saad', age:25}, {name:'rollins', age:5}, {name:'roman', age:15}])

		users = [{
			'name' : 'saad',
			'age' : 25,
		},
		{
			'name' : 'rollins',
			'age' : 10,
		},
		{
			'name' : 'roman',
			'age' : 15,
		}]


	Read : 
		db.users.find(filter, options) : return multiple filter records/documents.
		db.users.findOne(filter, options) : return only single matched element filtered record.

		db.users.find({ 'address.state' : 'Gujarat'}) :- for this kind of two dimension of fields are available then have to add qoutes in key as well.

		db.users.find({ name: 'test' }) :  find()
			- if i use only 'find()' and it find the record and it does not match with the condition then it returns pointer/nothing.
			- and at a time it returns max 20 records/documents. 
		db.user.fingOne({name :'test'}) : findOne()
			- if i use findOne() and doestn't get any 
		db.users.find().count() : 
			- it returns number of records/documents counter
		db.users.find.forEach((x) => {printjson(x)}) : using forEach and printjson can get all records/documents from that collection

Describe the development in your country like shopping center, park etcetera.
 - What is the development 
 - When you hear about it
 - How did it influence you?

I think developments in infrastructure are very essential for the progress of a nation.
Developments could be in any sectors like Education, Healthcare, Housing, Transportations etcetera.
Today, i would like to talk about a recent development in our country which is related to the transportation sector.
Last month our honourable Prime Minister Shri NarendraModiji inaugurated the first automatic driverless metro train in the national capital Delhi.
The launch of this train was covered by all the news channels and made headlines in the newspapers.
That is how i came to know about it.
This metro train connects several stations between New Delhi and Noida a city adjoining the national capital.
The launch of this trian has benefitted millions of people who otherwise travel by bus or other transportation means like their own cars and motorbikes.
It has reduced their travel time significantly and it has also become more convenient for them to travel from one place to another.
The coaches of the train are imported from the germany and are made of very high quality steels.
I believe that the government should introduce more such trains in the major cities of our country because it provides a lot of benefits to the people and the environment.
Moreover, it decreases the number of traffic jams in the city and the pollution caused when people use their own private vehicles.
This train has no driver, it is remotely controlled by a computer thus avoiding any human errors that can caused the accidents.
When i first told to my friends about this train, all of them were surprized to hear that a train can run without a driver as well.
This train has 8 coaches and capacity to carry 100 peoples at one time.
This coaches are very modern and have free wifi and phone charging facility as well.
The train also has seats reserved facility especially for the elderly and women.
But when i show them the news they were very excited about it.
we have also a plan to travel by this train to next month.


I believe that developments in infrastructure are crucial for the progress of a nation. 
	These developments can occur in various sectors, such as education, healthcare, housing, and transportation. 
	Today, I’d like to talk about a remarkable recent development in our country’s transportation sector.

Last month, our Honourable Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, inaugurated the nation’s first automatic driverless metro train in Delhi, the national capital. 
	The launch of this groundbreaking project was extensively covered by all the news channels and made headlines in newspapers, That is how i came to know about it.

This metro train connects multiple stations between New Delhi and Noida, a city adjacent to the capital. 
	Its introduction has benefitted millions of people who previously relied on buses or private vehicles like cars and motorbikes. 
	It has significantly reduced travel time and made commuting far more convenient.

The train’s coaches are imported from Germany and constructed with high-quality steel, ensuring durability and safety. 
	I believe the government should introduce more such trains in major cities across the country because they offer immense benefits to both people and the environment.
	These trains help alleviate traffic congestion and reduce pollution caused by the extensive use of private vehicles.

This train is fully automated and driverless, operated remotely by a computer system, which minimizes the risk of human errors and accidents. 
	When I first shared this news with my friends, they were amazed that a train could operate without a driver. 
	However, when I showed them the news coverage, they became just as excited as I was.

The train consists of eight modern coaches with a capacity to carry up to 100 passengers at a time. 
	These coaches are equipped with free Wi-Fi, phone charging facilities, and designated seating areas for women and the elderly, ensuring comfort and accessibility for all.

My family and I are planning to travel on this metro train next month to experience it firsthand. 
	This development truly represents a significant step forward for our country, highlighting the potential of advanced infrastructure to transform lives and create a more sustainable future.

3. What can be improve in public transportation services?

- Yes, I think young people are very interested in watching movies at the cinema, However the coming of OTT apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu have reduced their popularity to a certain extent.

In my life, I have never asked anyone for anything but there have been occasions when people have given gifts to me and it made me feel really happy.
Today i would like to talk about once such occasion when someone gifted me a thing that i was planning to buy on my own.
It was given to me by my brother who is working as an engineer in Canada.
My brother loves me very much and he is a kind hearted person.
He gifted me the latest iphone version and i was completely astonished when i came know that he got this phone for me.
I had been saving for this phone for months, but i still didn't have enough money to buy it.
i also read numerous reviews and watched several videos on youtube about this phone.
Its an awesome phone with great features like face recognition, wireless charging, and dual cameras.
My brother was visited us during last winter and saw me doing a lot of research about this phone on the internet.
He know that i wanted this phone badly.
So he went ahead and bought this phone for me without letting me know.
He gave this phone to me as a surprise on Christmas.
When i woke up in the Christmas morning the phone was lying inside a sock next to my bed.
At first i didn't believe if it was real or a dream but then when everyone started congratulating me, i felt elated.
I thanked to my brother a lot and i called him my santa claus.
So this was the moment when i felt extremely joyful on receiving something i really wanted.

Here’s an improved and polished version of your passage:

In my life, I have rarely asked anyone for anything. 			
	However, there have been occasions when people have given me gifts, which always made me feel incredibly happy.
 	Today, I’d like to talk about one such occasion when someone gifted me something I had been planning to buy for myself.

The gift was from my brother, who works as an engineer in Canada. 
	My brother is a kind-hearted person who loves me very much. 
	He surprised me with the latest iPhone, and I was completely astonished when I found out he had bought it for me.

I had been saving for this phone for months, but I still didn’t have enough money to purchase it. 
	During that time, I read numerous reviews and watched several videos on YouTube about this phone. 
	It’s an incredible device with amazing features like face recognition, wireless charging, and dual cameras.

Last winter, my brother visited us and saw me engrossed in researching this phone online. 
	He knew how much I wanted it, so he decided to buy it for me without letting me know. 
	On Christmas morning, he surprised me with the phone. 
	When I woke up, I found it inside a sock lying next to my bed.

At first, I couldn’t believe whether it was real or just a dream. 
	But when everyone started congratulating me, I felt overjoyed. 
	I thanked my brother profusely and even called him my Santa Claus.

This was a truly special moment when I felt an overwhelming sense of joy after receiving something I had longed for so deeply.

Task 2 :

Q. Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child’s development 
	while others think that it is important for children to go to school.
	- Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.
	- Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own 
		knowledge or experience.

Ans : 
	The Argument over whether learning at home or at school is better for children has not been settled yet. Whereas home education offers better protection whith individual learning and opportunities for families to bond, the schools have a comprehensive range of material and human resources. Ultimately, I think the school experience is best for children.
	There are several advantages for children who learn at home. Firstly, they can spend more time with their parents and siblings. Many social problems are associated with families not spending enough quality time together. Teaching children at home also provides them with an individualized learning environment. Instruction is custom designed and moves at the child's own pace and in accordance with his or her individual learning style. Finally, home schooling protects children from bullies and others who might be a bad influence.
	On the other hand, the school environment also offers advantages for children. Schools encourage children to socialise with their peers and learn how to cope with gossip, bullying and peer pressure. in Addition, children will receive better tuition across a range of disciplines, as schools have teachers who are trained in special subjects. What is more, the schools provide better access to physical resources such as sports equipment, musical instruments	and library books.
	I believe that children are better off in a school environment. Although family time and individual learning are important, the range of expertise and resources that the schools offers cannot be matched in the home. School environments may present difficult social situations, but so too does the real world and children must learn to navigate these on their own.

More and more elderly people are no longer cared for by their families and are instead placed in care homes and nursing homes.


Some people believe that teenagers should required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well.To what extent do you agree or disagree.

Answer : 
	Adolescents are the backbone of every country. Teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work as it helps them to learn important life skills.

	Children are the backbone of every country. So, there are people who tend to believe that youngsters should be encouraged to initiate social work as it will results in flourished society and individualistic growth of youngsters themselves. I, too believe that this motivation has more benefits than its drawbacks.

	To begin with,  social work by children can be easily associated with personality development because during this drive, they tend to communicate with variety of people, leads to polished verbal skills. For example, if they start convincing rural people to send their children in school they have to be such a convincing attitude along with developed verbal skills to deal with diverse kind of people there. This improved skill will help them lifelong in every arena. Apart from this, the true values of life like tolerance, patience, team spirit, cooperation can be learnt. 
	
	Besides that, young mind serve the country with full enthusiasm that gives them feeling of fulfillment and self satisfaction. This worthiness for themselves brim them with self confidence and patriotic feeling. Moreover, going and experiencing multiple culture and tradition make their horizon so broad that add one more feather in their cap.

	However, It is truly said, no rose without thrones. Can the drawbacks of this initiation be ignored? Children go to school, participate indifferent curriculum activities, endure the pressure of peers, parents, and teachers and in competitive world they should not be expected to serve society without their self benefits. This kind of pressure might bring resentment in their mind.

	In conclusion I believe, notion of teenager doing unpaid work is indeed good but proper monitoring and care should be given to avoid untoward consequences.

Pearson Test English : 

PTE Essay :

Q. 
	Some people think placing advertisements in schools is a great resource for public schools that need additional funding, 
	but others think it exploits children by treating them as a captive audience for corporate sponsors. 
	Choose which position you most agree with and discuss why you chose that position. Support your point of view with details from your own experiences, observations or reading.

	Answer :
	It is believed that advertisement is a prime source of a business which contributes to generating a large amount of fund for any organization or corporation like schools. However, some argue that schools are not an appropriate place to place an advertisement in the name of an exclusive fund collection. I will be in favour of the last notion.

	To begin with, placing advertisements in schools will distract juveniles who do not have controlling power on themselves as the psychological aspect of children needs to be considered before placing an advertisement in school. School children might less concentrate on their studies and more focus on colourful advertisements because of which their future will be uncertain as they will not be able to pass their course easily. For example, a child who is in the habit of involving in various advertising campaigns since childhood lacks behind on his or her studies. In the same way, young pupils will be obsessed with money, and if there is a shortage of money in any stage of their life while growing, they might indulge in an illegal act to achieve the money.

	On the other side of the fence, there are positive aspects as well, as children may get an excellent opportunity for the future, and they can shape their life by following only positive outcomes of advertisement.

	To conclude, the latter notion outweighs the first one as students should focus on their studies at this age rather than highlighting in another aspect like an advertisement. Therefore, Advertisements should be banned from the schools .we should ensure a pleasant and quiet place for kids to study.
